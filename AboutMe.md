# Ohi Longe

My name is Ohi Longe. I am Computer Science major at Northwest Missouri State University in my Senior Year. I hope to become a Machine Learning engineer and more in the near future. I have several hobbies such as gaming, watchin/playing soccer and going to lovely restuarants. My favorite video game is The Last Of Us series, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. It might not seem like much information but it is to me. 

I also like travelling and going to different states in the United States or outside of the country. One of my favorite places I've visited is Dubai because of their exotic lifestyle. I am also proud to be Nigerian and especially proud of Nigerian artistes and their massive influence to music in Africa and worldwide.
